        <ul>1 lb. ground beef</ul> 
        <ul>1/2 lb. sweet Italian sausage</ul>
        <ul>1 medium onion (-chopped)</ul>
        <ul>2 garlic cloves (-minced)</ul>
        <ul>1 (15 oz.) can tomato sauce</ul>

    <h4>Cooking Instructions</h4>
        <ol><strong>Step 1</strong>
            <p>In a Dutch oven, cook sausage, ground beef, onion, and garlic over medium 
                heat until well browned. Stir in crushed tomatoes, tomato paste, tomato 
                sauce, and water. Season with sugar, basil, fennel seeds, Italian 
                seasoning, 1 teaspoon salt, pepper, and 2 tablespoons parsley. Simmer,
                 covered, for about 1 1/2 hours, stirring occasionally.</p>
        </ol>
            


        <ol><strong>Step 2</strong>
            <p>Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook lasagna noodles 
                in boiling water for 8 to 10 minutes. Drain noodles, and rinse with cold 
                water. In a mixing bowl, combine ricotta cheese with egg, remaining 
                parsley, and 1/2 teaspoon salt.
            </p>
        </ol>
            
        
        <ol><strong>Step 3 </strong>
            <p>Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).</p>
        </ol>
        
        <ol><strong>Step 4 </strong>
            To assemble, spread 1 1/2 cups of meat sauce in the bottom of a 9x13-inch 
            baking dish. Arrange 6 noodles lengthwise over meat sauce. Spread with one
             half of the ricotta cheese mixture. Top with a third of mozzarella cheese 
             slices. Spoon 1 1/2 cups meat sauce over mozzarella, and sprinkle with 1/4 
             cup Parmesan cheese. Repeat layers, and top with remaining mozzarella and 
             Parmesan cheese. Cover with foil: to prevent sticking, either spray foil 
             with cooking spray, or make sure the foil does not touch the cheese.
        </ol>

        <ol><strong>Step 5</strong>
            <p>Bake in preheated oven for 25 minutes. Remove foil, and bake an additional 25 
            minutes. Cool for 15 minutes before serving.</p>
        </ol>
